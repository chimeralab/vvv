The defense analyst performs a crucial role by anticipating, understanding, and coordinating an efficient and successful response to ongoing cyber threats. This study was concerned with how certain qualities of the data environment make a cyber defenders job more difficult. In the present experiment, we were interesting in evaluating out how increasing the amount of information to process, decreasing the time to make a decision, decreasing the veracity of the information presented, and increasing the variety of information available impacted your ability to identify threatening patterns in a batch of cyber events. In our future work, we hope to develop agents to help reduce the impacts of these factors on the human cyber defender.",
